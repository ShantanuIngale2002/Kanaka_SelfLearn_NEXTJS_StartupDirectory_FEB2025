Theory in notebook but project started at 1:05



Installations >>

i. Next's Auth.js : https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=next-js
	> npm i next-auth
ii. tailwind other libraries:
	> npm i @tailwindcss/typography tailwindcss-animate



Created yc_directory, open in vs code and using terminal:
	> npx create-next-app@latest ./
	> TS : y (type script)
	> ESLint : y (eslint for clean code)
	> tailwind : y (styling)
	> src : n (not required)
	> app router : y  (will be using router)
	> turbo pack : y (smooth app execution)
	> import alias : n (no need)

- In package.json we have to add two properties, since next-auth and other packages should be latest, not using react 18, add this in between scripts and dependencies :
	"packageManager": "npm@10.5.2",
  	"overrides": {
   		"react": "$react",
    		"react-dom": "$react-dom"
  	},


- For Auth, using Next's Auth.js
	> npm i next-auth@beta
	> npx auth secret    then y

- Created 'yc_directory/auth.ts' and paste the code from doc for starter
- Created 'app/auth/[...nextauth]/auth.ts and pasted code from doc for starter
- Now from scratch getting GitHub-OAuth, go to connections/providers/GitHub in docs from left-side-bar
	> 1. GitHub - Create OAuth : https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app
		> Follow for steps and add app name and desc but for below add values as:
			- Homepage URL : http://localhost:3000 (for starter)
			- authorization callback : https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github  (from doc)
		> Create application
		> Now click on generate a new client secret
		> in .env.local add Client Id and Secret as :
			- AUTH_GITHUB_ID="[id]"
			- AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="[secret]"
		> downloaded - shuttle icon and added to application logo
		> update auth.ts with code on doc
			import NextAuth from "next-auth"
			import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
 			export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  				providers: [GitHub],
			})

- Now using tutorial's readme.MD, Copy custom "tailwind.config.ts" and globals.css custom css style properties.
- Installing tailwind pakages:
	> npm i @tailwindcss/typography tailwindcss-animate

- Now installing shad-cn:
	> goto https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli
	> in vs terminal use cli cmd : npx shadcn@latest init

While scripting above files issue I got and solved:

1. posts have temp array data (posts), where post._createdAt = new Date(...). Now here was a issue of passing Date Object. Solution:
	- using Ctrl+P in VSCode search 'utils.ts' and add this function below cn() :

export function formatDate(date: string){
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-IN", {
    month: 'long',
    day: "numeric",
    year: "numeric"
  });
}

2. The app has trust issue with image link from post.image. Solution:
	- using Crtl+P in VSCode search 'next.config.ts' and update NextConfig var as :

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "*"
      }
    ]
  }
};


 

- Added shadcn's Button using > npx shadcn@latest add button
- New components/ui/Button.tsx is created now move all our "components" into that newly created components folder at 'ui' folder level and delete old.


- Now, logged in using GitHub to Sanity . io
- Created Project StartupDirectory (next js, from scratch)
- From overview, copy CLI cmd
